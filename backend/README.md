# QAU academic advisor backend

The chat evidence pipeline, audit findings, setup instructions, evaluation, and
deployment requirements are documented in [the RAG upgrade guide](../docs/RAG_UPGRADE.md).
Start there when configuring or reviewing the chatbot.

The versioned public-source crawler, offline imports, scheduled refresh,
feedback migration and reviewed evaluation workflow are documented in
[the knowledge pipeline guide](../docs/KNOWLEDGE_PIPELINE.md).

The backend exposes verified structured academic data without using an LLM as a
source of truth.

## Run

```powershell
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Implemented endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/health`
- `GET /api/v1/health/database`
- `GET /api/v1/programs`
- `GET /api/v1/courses/{course_code}`
- `GET /api/v1/courses/{course_code}/prerequisites`
- `GET /api/v1/fees`
- `GET /api/v1/timetable`
- `POST /api/v1/nlp/analyze`
- `GET /api/v1/nlp/model`
- `POST /api/v1/rules/prerequisite-check`
- `POST /api/v1/rules/semester-load`
- `POST /api/v1/rules/progression`
- `POST /api/v1/rules/exemption`
- `POST /api/v1/rag/search`

The NLP endpoint returns language, intent, confidence, extracted entities, and
the exact model backend/name that produced the classification. The primary
classifier is a trained multilingual DistilBERT model for English, Roman Urdu,
and Urdu script. A reproducible n-gram classifier is retained only as a clearly
reported availability fallback. Model readiness is inspectable through
`GET /api/v1/nlp/model`.

The prerequisite response always reports that the public prerequisite dataset is
incomplete. An empty prerequisite array must not be interpreted as academic
eligibility. Timetable responses similarly identify when no current verified
operational data is loaded.

## Tests

```powershell
cd backend
python -m pytest
```

Database-backed endpoint integration tests require PostgreSQL initialized from
the root `docker-compose.yml`.

## Complete FYP workflows

The API also implements registration/login, authenticated chat persistence,
query history, public policies/deadlines/exams, and administrator management for
courses, fees, timetables, policies, user accounts, query logs, and date-ranged
reports. A fresh database seeds the `admin@cs.qau.edu.pk` account with a publicly
known bootstrap password. Replace it right after the first start with
`python scripts/set_admin_password.py` (see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)).
